Meanwhile, Indonesia has the potential for water sources of up to 3.9 trillion m3 every year and only 20% of which can only be maximized [2]. The national electrification ratio of Indonesia is 95.35 percent where the electrification growth ratio is in eastern Indonesia, NTT (59.85 percent) and Papua (61.42 percent) so that the realization and utilization of water is not optimal, especially in areas where the state-owned electricity company has not electrified due to the difficulty of accessing water for irrigation [3].

In this case, we have established a method that can be applied only to easily accessible places and can also be applied in remote areas. The design of the technology offered is based on a DC system that uses solar cell power (photovoltaic-PV) as an independent power supply to run a water pump, such as a submersible pump. This design is important for a pump to be configured to provide water access so that the distributed water can operate properly. In its application, solar powered pumps can be used in residential, livestock and even irrigation environments where their use includes water that is not reliant on the electrification of the state electricity company.",

            par3 : "One indicator that can be used as a reference in determining the quality of a transformer is its health index. In detail, the transformer health index is a comprehensive assessment of the condition of the transformer and an objective and quantitative scientific approach. In general, the health conditions of transformers are influenced by several factors, such as electrical, mechanical, and chemical factors. The diversity of transformer conditions and parameter testing (transformer oil, furans and dissolved gases) raises an assessment related to the health transformer index. In the end this can be used as a basis for concluding the overall condition of the power transformer [1].",
            par4 : "Combined observations from operating observations, field inspections, and laboratory tests can be used as references in the evaluation of transformer conditions. One of the challenges is how to translate the test measurement data with its importance and influence on the health condition of the transformer. In the literature, several learning studies on health index methods refer to industry standards and expert judgment [1]. This study discusses the data from transformer testing at PT. PLN (Persero) Certification Center, which the test is carried out on the Power Transformers to determine the health index of the transformer. There are several studies that discuss  the transformers lifetime, but hopefully this study can be more comprehensive because it uses the data from the overall test results of the transformer. The tests include the transformer oil, furans and dissolved gases. This study was aimed to obtain  the predictions of the life of Power Transformers using Artificial Neural Network applications based on three input tests carried out on the transformer.",
            par5 : "After calculating each parameter, the artificial neural network was finally able to model the history of the transformer, so that it could directly predict the life of transformer, both the new transformer and the operating one. In the final assessment there were several values. The values can be classified in three types of results, namely: (a) a conditions where the calculation of health index transformer was in accordance with the calculation of artificial neural networks; (b) a condition of the calculation of health index transformer was close to the calculation of artificial neural networks; and (c) a condition of the calculation of health index transformer was a little far from the calculation of artificial neural networks.",
            par6 : "Artificial neural networks in this research succeeded in modeling the results of the total health transformer index, to be used as program input reference data. In this study artificial neural networks used the backpropagation feedforward method, where the results of the prediction have approached the calculation value of the transformer health index which has been a representation of the condition of the transformer. The error value in this study was quite low, in which the output value and target for the testing of artificial neural networks were  compared and the errors were searched using the Mean Square Error method. This method is used to minimize the occurrence of errors in the prediction of the life of the transformer. So, in this study, the Mean Square Error obtained for the prediction of 50 transformer units in the dissolved gas test was 0.0020, in the transformer insulating oil was 0.000934, and the transformer final value was 0.0022.",
